FoldMusic.
by Ariel Aouizerate & theiostream.

##### About
FoldMusic is a MobileSubstrate extension for iOS which allows you to create folders on the homescreen like the icon folders, which contain instead of icons, a list of songs.

The folders are created by users in a preference panel and can be formed from either an album or from a playlist.

##### On open-source
Even though this is a paid product sold for $1.5 dollars in the Cydia Store, I decided to dare the standard model of how tweaks are distributed and see if I will manage to get any contributors to this project (that's quite needed!)

This software is licensed under the zlib license (see below), which I guess covers this software's rights nicely. Please respect it (or at least read it).

##### Contributing
I gladly take extensively tested patches to FoldMusic in the form of a pull request. Although, if you find yourself in a situation where your patch must be distributed in the form of another package, the following instructions must be followed:

1. DO NOT in any way sell this software or release a free alternative with minor changes to the project.
2. Change the name and the bundle identifier of this project and make it conflict with the original package.
3. Do not in any way use the authors of this project as a mean to endorse your patch.

IF THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT FOLLOWED I *WILL* TERMINATE THIS PROJECT.
